    as `true`. The strip happens after a quoted value too, so
    `SSO_ONLY_MODE="true" # sso only` also arrives as `true` - measured on the

    Compose. It survives when the hash is inside the quotes
    (`"true # sso only"`), when there is no space before the hash (`true# sso only`),
    or when it comes from a vehicle that does no such parsing: an Unraid template
    field, a literal in the compose `environment:` block, or a `docker run -e`
    argument quoted to keep the hash (unquoted at a shell, the shell strips it).

    Deliberately not applied to the other booleans in this file. Changing what
